GLOBAL TODOS
============
* some better structure for external drives and such
    - symlinks from $HOME/media into $HOME?
    - or just some slightly more standardized $HOME/media setup
* gtk/qt config
* fonts
* better distinction between stuff for .config and stuff for ~
* config files vs documentation, how and where to organize it?
* install script
    - put/symlink config files to their correct places
    - add redacted info to some?
    - create needed directories in $HOME? (bin, builds, media, etc)
* vimium config?
